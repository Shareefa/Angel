# Drowning-Detector

Detection of drowning people using a regular neural network. We took sections of images from videos as our data input to our model and two nodes as an output layer, one for drowning one for non-drowning. 

Implementation of this type of neural network was done with the help of https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/10/an-introduction-to-implementing-neural-networks-using-tensorflow/
